# Simple_Sample_Map
Some code to automatically plot sample collection data with water features from Open Street Maps

1. Establishes a bounding box around the sampling points and extract water features from this location from Open Street Maps
2. Makes dataframes from the waterway features (rivers/streams/drains) and the water features (lakes/ponds)
3. Plots the sampling points and the water features
4. Plots the bounding box of the sampling sites on the country the samples were collected from to show broad scale of sampling
